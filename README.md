# Software Engineering Series
| Prerequisite: Almost series is written in Typescript or Javascript, so you should be familiar with them

## Disclaimer
This series is implemented based on my own experience and some reference sources. I am always open to sharing and getting contributions from everyone. Thank you in advanced.

## Usage
1. First, make sure you have installed **typescript** in your machine, if not you can run:
    ```console
    pc@admin:~$ npm install -g typescript
    ```
2. Run the Typescript build
    - Open Visual Studio Code , execute **Run Build Task** (⇧⌘B) from the global Terminal menu
    - Or you can open your terminal at this project and run this command
    ```console
    pc@admin:~$ tsc -p .
    ```
3. Now you can see **build** folder is where your typescript code has been transpiled into javascript
4. Test the code in **build** folder, for example:
    ```console
    pc@admin:~$ node build/tree/test.js
    ```
